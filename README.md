# Sudoku React component

This module includes the `<SudokuGrid />` React component, which prints a sudoku grid to the page.

The `state` of the `<SudokuGrid />` component has a `grid` variable with an array of integer arrays representing the values in each row of the sudoku. Zeroes are used to represent blank spaces.
